abstract = {Background: Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is common, although the exact pathophysiology is unknown. It is plausible that hypotension after surgery is relevant for the development of myocardial injury. The authors evaluated whether low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) after surgery are related to an increased incidence in postoperative cardiac-troponin elevation. Methods: A prospective cohort of 2211 patients aged ≥60 yr, undergoing major or moderate noncardiac surgery in The Netherlands, was retrospectively analysed for the occurrence of postoperative cardiac-troponin elevation [high-sensitive troponin T (hsTnT) >14 ng L−1]. Blood pressures after surgery were recorded and divided into quartiles based on the lowest MAP prior to peak troponin recording. The association between MAP and extent of postoperative cardiac-troponin elevation was analysed. Results: The patients were divided into quartiles based on their lowest MAP in the period preceding the peak hsTnT, ranging from a median of 62 in the lowest quartile to 94 in the highest quartile. Postoperative hsTnT elevation was present in 53.2% of the population. An association between MAP quartile and postoperative peak hsTnT was predominantly observed in the lowest quartile (P<0.001): median hsTnT 17.6 (10.3–37.3), 14.9 (9.4–24.6), 13.8 (9.1–22.5), and 14.0 (9.2–22.4). The multivariable logistic-regression analysis showed an increased risk for postoperative cardiac-troponin elevation with decreasing MAP thresholds. Conclusions: Lower postoperative blood pressure is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative cardiac hsTnT elevation, irrespective of pre- and intraoperative variables.},
