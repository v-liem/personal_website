**Background:** Pre- and intraoperative tachycardia in noncardiac surgery have demonstrated to be associated with postoperative myocardial injury and death. These findings are well accepted because heart rate is considered a crucial component in the myocardial oxygen supply and demand balance. However, much less is known about tachycardia in the postoperative period. This current study aims to examine postoperative tachycardia, reviewing multiple thresholds, and it’s association with myocardial injury in noncardiac surgery.

**Methods:** This current study population was derived from a prospective troponin surveillance cohort, from 2012 to 2017 at the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, and was retrospectively analyzed. Patients were aged ≥ 60 years, underwent moderate to major noncardiac surgery and had frequent postoperative hemodynamic monitoring on a postoperative high-dependency ward for up to 24 hours. Intra- and postoperative hemodynamic parameters were recorded and extracted. The primary study endpoint was myocardial injury (defined as a peak high-sensitive troponin T ≥ 50 ng/L) within the first postoperative 3 days. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between postoperative heart rate and myocardial injury.

**Results:** The study consisted of 1691 patients, of which 223 (13%) had postoperative myocardial injury. Postoperative tachycardia was common; with 14% of the patients experiencing a heart rate ≥100 beats per minute (bpm) for at least one hour. A higher mean of 10 bpm postoperative heart rate was associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17 – 1.50; P < 0.001). A 10% relative higher mean postoperative heart rate compared to patients’ baseline heart rate was also associated with an increased risk (aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00 – 1.24; P = 0.047). Furthermore, a cumulative duration of more than 310 minutes ≥ 90 bpm (aOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.00 – 4.00; P = 0.015) and approximately a cumulative duration of more than 2 hours  ≥ 100 bpm (aOR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.21 – 4.80; P = 0.002) were independently associated with myocardial injury (Table 1). 

**Conclusion:** On a high-dependency ward, postoperative tachycardia was independently associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury. Further research is warranted if postoperative tachycardia is refractory, a mere reflection of an underlying disease and/or whether it is a modifiable risk factor for myocardial injury.
