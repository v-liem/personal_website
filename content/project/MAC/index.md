**Background:** Volatile anesthetics have cardioprotective properties and have shown to reduce postoperative myocardial injury in cardiac surgery. In noncardiac surgery, studies have failed to replicate the same beneficial effects compared to total intravenous anesthesia. However, it is unclear whether the effects on the myocardium are dose dependent. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of sevoflurane concentration on myocardial injury in noncardiac surgery.

**Methods:** This observational study selected from a troponin surveillance cohort comprised of 2049 patients aged ≥60 years undergoing moderate and major noncardiac surgery restricted to a sevoflurane-based anesthesia regimen. End-tidal sevoflurane concentrations were recorded at 1 minute intervals and age-related minimal alveolar concentrations (MAC) were determined. The primary study endpoint was myocardial injury, defined as a peak high-sensitive troponin T ≥50 ng/L, during the first 3 postoperative days. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between MAC and myocardial injury.

**Results:** Patients were divided into quartiles based on their mean intraoperative MAC; lowest (<0.94), low (0.94 – 1.04), high (1.04 – 1.15), highest (>1.15). Overall, 209 patients (10%) had postoperative myocardial injury and the incidence stepwise decreased with higher MAC concentrations (Table 1). Compared to the lowest mean MAC quartile, a high (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 – 0.81; P = 0.006) and the highest mean MAC (aOR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29 – 0.78; P = 0.003) were associated with a reduced risk of postoperative myocardial injury, after adjusting for potential confounders. 

**Conclusion:** Higher intraoperative sevoflurane concentrations during moderate and major noncardiac surgery were associated with a reduction of postoperative myocardial injury, irrespective of intraoperative heart rate or blood pressure.
