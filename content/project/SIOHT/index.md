**Background:** Perioperative myocardial injury is a major contributor of postoperative mortality and intraoperative tachycardia was assumed related due to promoting increased oxygen demand and impaired coronary perfusion. However, conflicting evidence has put the association between intraoperative tachycardia and myocardial injury under debate and propose tachycardia as a mere surrogate marker of hypotension. The aim of this study was to examine both tachycardia and hypotension, as single events and when simultaneous occurring during noncardiac surgery, and the association with postoperative death, kidney and myocardial injury.

**Methods:** This study, derived from a prospective troponin surveillance cohort from 2012 to 2017, followed patients aged ≥60 years undergoing moderate to major noncardiac surgery. An absolute MAP threshold below 65 mmHg was used to define hypotension (IOH) and an absolute heart rate threshold above 100 bpm to define tachycardia (IOT). A simultaneous occurrence of intraoperative hypotension and tachycardia was marked as SIOHT (Fig 1) and cumulative duration was consequently calculated. The primary study endpoint was myocardial injury (defined as a peak hs-Troponin T ≥ 50ng/L) during the first 3 postoperative days. Secondary endpoints were acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association between SIOHT and study endpoints.

**Results:** The total cohort comprised of 4547 patients. 2233 (49%) experienced at least a single episode of IOH without any IOT, 273 (6%) a single episode IOT without any IOH, 939 (21%) experienced both IOH and IOT episodes separate during surgery, 366 (8%) an episode of SIOHT and 736 (16%) no event at all. Patients with a SIOHT had a higher incidence of myocardial injury (19%), AKI (27%) and 30-day mortality (5%) compared to patients with no episodes of IOH and/or IOT (12% myocardial injury; 17% AKI; 2% 30-day mortality). After adjusting for potential confounders, a 5 min (aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.22 – 2.69; P= 0.003), 6 – 10 min (aOR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.22 – 5.51; P = 0.010), 11 – 30 min (aOR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.56 – 6.60; P = 0.001) and >30 min (aOR, 3.66; 95% CI, 1.62 – 7.94; P = 0.001) cumulative duration of SIOHT was associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury (Fig 2). Moreover, a decrease in short- and long term survival was observed in patients who experienced a SIOHT episode (Fig 3; log-rank test, P < 0.001).

**Conclusion:** Patients who experienced a simultaneous episode of hypotension and tachycardia during noncardiac surgery had a higher incidence of AKI, myocardial injury and mortality. Furthermore, longer cumulative durations were independently associated with myocardial injury. Whether this cardiovascular phenomenon is an expression of underlying shock or a modifiable risk factor needs to be determined.
