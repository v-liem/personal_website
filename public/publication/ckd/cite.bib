abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that postoperative troponin release is a strong and independent predictor of short-term mortality. However, evaluating elevated troponins in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still controversial and is often disregarded. This study examines morbidity along with short- and long-term mortality risk associated with elevated high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) in patients with different stages CKD undergoing noncardiac surgery. METHODS: This observational cohort comprised 3262 patients aged >/=60 yr who underwent noncardiac surgery. Postoperative hsTnT concentrations were divided into normal [<14 ng l(-1) (reference)], low (14-49 ng l(-1)), moderate (50-149 ng l(-1)), and high (>/=150 ng l(-1)) groups. A threshold of 50 ng l(-1) was used to dichotomize hsTnT. The study endpoints were 30-day and long-term all-cause mortality, and postoperative myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Postoperative hsTnT was associated with a stepwise increase in 30-day and long-term mortality risk: low hsTnT adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.7], moderate hsTnT adjusted HR 3.1 (95% CI: 2.3-4.3), high hsTnT adjusted HR 5.5 (95% CI: 3.6-8.4). Postoperative hsTnT >/=50 ng l(-1) was associated with 30-day and long-term mortality risk for each stage of CKD. Elevated troponin concentrations in severe CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)), however, did not predict short-term death. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated postoperative hsTnT is associated with a dose-dependent increase in 30-day and long-term mortality risk in each stage of CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >/=30 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2).},
